      Yao Guang's Path is confirmed as "The Elation," and her combat attribute is "Physical." Combining this with earlier leaks, she is essentially confirmed to be an "Elation support" character. As the "opening character" (the first new release of this version), Yao Guang's appeal may be somewhat limited, and sales momentum is likely to be carried by the follow-up character, Sparxie.

        Sparxie is an upcoming 5-star Fire character on the Path of Elation in Honkai: Star Rail. Known for her high-energy, streamer-like persona, she embodies spectacle and chaos, turning battles into flashy performances. Closely linked to Sparkle and the Masked Fools, Sparxie is expected to function as a Fire main DPS, bringing explosive gameplay and Elation-style mechanics to Version 4.0.
