      Fugue is a potent Break and Super Break focused Nihility support. She allows the team to easily deal Super Break damage against Weakness Broken enemies and is the first unit ever to be able to forcibly apply Exo Toughness to enemies, letting them get Broken a second time before recovering. She also allows a single ally to reduce enemy Toughness regardless of Type while also reducing the attacked enemies DEF. 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐟 𝐝𝐢𝐝𝐧'𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐚 (𝐃𝐚𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐚 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫)

        Lingsha is an exceptionally powerful Abundance sustain unit. Similar to Gallagher, Lingsha consolidates efficient and potent teamwide healing with staggeringly high Toughness damage, both in single-target and AoE scenarios. She has a summoned entity called Fuyuan that acts like Numby, having its own turn in the Action Order and attacking independently of Lingsha. Fuyuan attacks in an AoE and heals the entire party in the same action, and will even provide a teamwide cleanse. When you factor in that she will also debuff enemies to make them take 25% more Break DMG. 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦

      Aglaea is a powerful new Remembrance unit. She is an entirely CRIT-focused DPS character with her own unique summoned entity. Aglaea can become one of the fastest-acting characters during combat and has mechanics to increase the damage of herself and her summon based on their SPD values as well. Her extremely expensive 350 Energy cost Ultimate further enhances herself and her summon to become lightning-fast and lets her attack at a ridiculous rate. 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐥

        Sunday is an excellent Harmony support specializing in 100% Action Advance for both a character and their respective summoned entity if they have one. He provides a lot of the same value as Bronya does while also granting greater benefits when buffing characters with summons and being more SP-positive at the same time. Sunday also provides a percent Max Energy restore for a chosen ally and grants them further CRIT DMG buffs based on Sunday's CRIT DMG. 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐥
